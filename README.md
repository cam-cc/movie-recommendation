# Movie Recommendation

<p> The goal is to apply different techniques to build recommendation systems such as Rank-based & Collaborative Filtering-based recommendation systems to recommend Movies to users. </p>

<p> the data set consists of 671 unique users and 9,066 movies </p>

<p> using four models in particular
  <ul>Model 1: Rank-Based Recommendation System</ul>
  <ul>Model 2: User based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System</ul>
  <ul>Model 3: Item based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System</ul>
  <ul>Model 4: Based Collaborative Filtering - Matrix Factorization using SVD</ul>
</p>

<p>
 The results showed that the tuned models performed better, with the user-user based tuned model showing the best performance. Collaborative Models' ability to utilize user-item-ratings data to make predictions and find similarities was identified as a key factor in their improved performance. However, tuning the SVD matrix factorization model did not result in significant improvements. Matrix Factorization, on the other hand, had a lower RMSE due to its ability to assume both items and users are present in a low dimensional space that describes their characteristics, which enables recommendations based on proximity in this space and accounts for latent factors.
